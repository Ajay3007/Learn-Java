# INHERITANCE
    An existing class can be extended by adding additional capabilities. Such a class is called a subclass. Subclasses inherite all the properties of the parent classes. This process is known as inheritance.
    A subclass inherits all instance variables and methods from its superclass and also has its own instance variables and methods. This principle helps to build classes for complex problems and also avoid the repetation of codes in the new class. 
    To create a subclass, the keyword 'extends' is used in the class definition.
