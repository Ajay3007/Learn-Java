Increment --> ++
Decrement --> --
  The prefix operator (++var or --var) changes (inc by 1 or dec by 1) the value of the variable first and uses the variable.
  When postfix operator (var++ or var--) is used, the value of the variable is used in the operation and then changes the value
  (inc by 1 or dec by 1).
The ++ and -- operators do not operate on integer literals. Therefore, 25++ or --85 are not valid.
