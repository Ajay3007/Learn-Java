    *An array is a variable representing a collection of like-typed data. Arrays are useful in representing vectors, matrices, strings and
tables. When an array is created, it reserves a specified number of memory locations to strore the values of a collection of data of a particular type. 
    *Each of the memory location is identified by an index associated with the array variable.
    *An array is treated as an object.
    
## ONE-DIMENTIONAL ARRAY
    In Java, an array is created in two steps:
    1. An array variable is to be declared.
    2. An array object is to be created using 'new' operator by specifying number of memory locations required.
        int numb[];             // declares an array variable numb of type int.
        numb = new int[12];     // allocates memory for 12 int type.
        Now, numb can handle 12 int type values, each value can be accessed by using values 0 to 11. Suppose, the 12 values are 7, 45,          3, 4, 26, 35, 40, 75, 99, 125, 54, 65, the array will be referred by the index given below:
        numb[0]---> 7
        numb[1]---> 45
        numb[2]---> 3
        .           .
        .           .
        .           .
        numb[11]---> 65
    The declaration of array and creation of array can be done in a single statement.
        int numb[] = new int[12];
  #Array initialization
        Array can be initialized by writting the values inside the braces { . , . , ... }. The above array can be written as:
        int numb[] = {7, 45, 3, 4, ... , 65};
        In that case the number of elements need not be specified.
        
## MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY
    The following statement declare and allocate memory of a 3 X 4 matrix of int type:
        int mat[][] = new int[3][4];    // this statement creates matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns.
    In java it is possible to have rows of varrying columns as given below:
        int mat[][] = new int[3][];
        mat[0] = new int[2];
        mat[1] = new int[3];
        mat[2] = new int[4];
    Multi-dimentional array can be initialized like one-dimentional array.
        int mat[][] = {{.,.,..}, {.,.,...}, ... , {.,.,..}};
